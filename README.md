Fill out all of the above before submitting your assignment.  

If you use any resources that help you (e.g. a book, web page, another person), you should list all 
of them in the "Sources" section above.  When in doubt, cite it.  Be specific and include a description of 
how the source was helpful. List the specific page, not an entire web site. For example, simply citing 
stackoverflow.com is not sufficient. Instead, cite the URL of the specific page that was helpful to you.
Note that it is not necessary to cite the Java API documentation, the class textbook, lab TAs/instructors, 
or other resources provided by your instructor. 

Note that you may not collaborate or utilize a resource in a way that is prohibited (see Syllabus), even 
if you cite the collaboration or resource.
